CORE QUESTIONS
-----------------
- What’s Given vs. What’s Required?
- Try 5 sample inputs manually.
- Analyze constraints:
  - Any fake bounds?
  - Constant behavior after point?
  - What complexity is allowed?
INVESTIGATION FLOW
----------------------
1. Recognize Domain:
   Graph / DP / Math / String / Geometry?
   
2. Identify Core Influence:
   - What truly affects the output?

3. List Observations:
   - Patterns, Monotonicity, Symmetry, Periodicity

4. Divide into Subproblems:
   - Can parts be solved independently?

5. Try Brute Force:
   - How many decisions?
   - Is it exponential or polynomial?
   - Can you prune, memo, compress?

6. Visualize:
   - Draw array, graph, transitions

7. Reformulate:
   - DP recurrence? Graph structure?

8. Search Space:
   - Binary/Ternary Search?
   - Meet in the middle?

9. Reverse Logic:
   - Work from output to input

10. Simplify or Reduce:
    - Try N = 1, 2, edge cases
    - Greedy guess and validate

11. Rank Ideas:
    - Feasibility > Simplicity > Speed

 Works for both Directed and Undirected Graphs
 A Eulerian path is a path in a graph that passes through all of its edges exactly once. A Eulerian cycle is a Eulerian path that is a cycle.
  -------------------------------
 Requirements:
     For Undirected Euler Circuit:
         - All vertices have even degree
     For Undirected Euler Path:
         - Exactly 2 vertices have odd degree
     For Directed Euler Circuit:
         - For every vertex: in-degree == out-degree
     For Directed Euler Path:
         - Exactly one vertex with out-in = 1 (start)
         - Exactly one vertex with in-out = 1 (end)
     - Path lenght must be n + 1 where n in number of nodes

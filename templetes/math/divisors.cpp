if you're dividing something (e.g., grid, people, blocks), HCNs make ideal candidates since they divide easily due to many factors.

        Divisbility Rules :

        Number is divisible by 2 if last digit equal 0,2,4,6,8

        Number is divisible by 3 if sum of digits divisible by 3

        Number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits divisible by 4  
        ex: 1936  36%4==0

        Number is divisible by 5 if last digit is 0 or 5

        Number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 & 3

        Number is divisible by 8 if the last 3 digits is divisible by 8

        Number is divisible by 9 if sum of digits if divisible by 9

        Number is divisible by 10 is the last digit is 0

        Number is divisible by 11 is the difference between
        Odd indexes and even indexes is divisible by 11

        Number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by 3 and 4
